# GrooveSharedUtils
A RoR2 utilities pack to streamline mod setup, development, and organization. GrooveSharedUtils focuses on runtime-based content creation.

## Structure
Most of GrooveSharedUtils is build around a specific mod archecture that should be easy to setup and expand.
### Mod Plugins and Modules
A `ModPlugin` inherits from BepInEx's `BaseUnityPlugin`; each assembly is limited to a single `ModPlugin`. Your plugin serves as the base of a mod made with GrooveSharedUtils: PLUGIN options define a BepInEx plugin, ENV (Environment) options define global settings for your mod, and the plugin additionally functions as a content pack. Your plugin instantiates and manages classes that inherit from `ModModule` in your assembly.
### Asset Display Cases and Streams
The `AssetDisplayCase` attribute can be applied to any class, and indicates that static fields in the class and its nested classes can serve as holders for your mod's assets (think `RoR2Content`). Every module implements the `OnCollectContent` method, which provides access to an `AssetStream`. This method is called as your plugin is building its content pack. Assets added to the asset stream will be mapped to their appropriate locations (`ItemDefs` and `EquipmentDefs` to the content pack, `ModdedDotDefs` to DoTAPI, etc.) and will also be mapped to any asset display case fields, matched by type and name.

## Frames
Frames are helper classes to assist with a specific runtime task. For example an `ItemFrame` wraps RoR2's `ItemDef`, creating the scriptable object while exposing relevant fields to the user. GrooveSharedUtil's library of frames is never complete, please reach out with suggestions for new frames.
